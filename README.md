# Belly_Button

## Belly Button Diversity Challenge. 

We were tasked with adding a horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart, and a gauge chart for the volunteers so they can identify if the bacterial species in their belly button is a canidate for synthetic beef. After that we needed to customize the dashboard to make it more inviting.
